# What is the NAME of your project?
Permaweb Writer

# What DOES THE PROJECT DO/what will you SHOW?
Permaweb Writer is basically Dropbox Paper on IPFS (as if it's not difficult enough ðŸ¤£).
It's also the first consumer app built on IPFS (and Textile).
Write Markdown notes, todos, presentations, publish blog posts or pastebins.
In the coming versions we're going to add a Dropbox like functionality, where you can upload images and files too (and get versioning for free because IPFS!).
You can also use it as a headless CMS.

_Briefly explain your madcap decentralized science experiment and why it will excite and inspire the fair attendees :)_
We are showing off the first consumer app on IPFS, and taking on Dropbox!
